/**
 * WifiEnrollmentJsContractTest — source contract for the client-side gate.
 *
 * This repo has no JS test runner, and adding one is out of scope for this
 * change, so this follows the existing convention (see the existing source-analysis tests)
 * and statically analyses the shipped bundle.
 *
 * Be honest about what that buys: this proves the handlers are wired and the
 * required branches exist. It does NOT execute them, so it cannot prove the
 * interaction actually behaves correctly in a browser. The server-side gate in
 * WifiGateEnforcementTest is the guarantee that matters; this is a guard
 * against the wiring being deleted or drifting.
